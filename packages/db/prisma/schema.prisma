// So firstly create a model that is train model using that Model Db thing you created  u give the images to it to train the model 
// after traing the model the model is generated we need to created different models because there could be diff persons 
// then we give prompt after selecting the model and it will generate images based on that model

// we have a pack which in that case is going to be have some prelisted prompts
// after clicking on pack thing we have to select out model first and then that images will come in that pac
